## Welcome to Nikel API

Nikel (pronunciation: `/'ni:kɛl/`) is a collection of data APIs on information about the University of Toronto.

### API Wrappers

##### Official

* [nikel-ts (Node.js)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nikel)

##### Unofficial

* [nikel-rs (Rust)](https://crates.io/crates/nikel-rs)

Please feel free to [add your own API wrapper](https://github.com/nikel-api/nikel-docs/edit/master/docs/welcome.md) to this list!

:::note Important

**This API is still currently in development. Some endpoints may change.**

**If something breaks, please check the documentation for any recent breaking changes or contact [api@nikel.ml](mailto:api@nikel.ml).**

Although the API is free, there are very lenient rate limits posed to prevent API abuse.

The current rate limit is **20 requests per second for uncached requests**. Cached requests are not subjected to ratelimits.
